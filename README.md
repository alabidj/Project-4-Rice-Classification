Project Proposal: Classification of Rice using CNN

Objective statement:
To develop a deep learning-based rice image classification model using TensorFlow
that can accurately identify and categorize different types of rice grains from 
images. The project aims to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to 
process visual features of rice grains and classify them into predefined categories 

Step-by-Step Flow for Your Project:

Build the CNN Model:
Load and preprocess the rice image dataset.
Design and train the CNN model for rice classification.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy.
Save the trained model for later use.

Create a Flask API:
Set up a Flask application.
Load the trained model in the Flask backend.
Create an endpoint to allow users to upload images.
Use the model to predict the rice type and return the result as a response.

Visualize Results in Tableau:
Export prediction data (e.g., class, accuracy) as a CSV file.
Design visualizations to display insights:
Class distribution of predictions.
Performance metrics and trends.
Create dashboards to summarize findings.

Store Predictions in SQL:
Design a SQL database schema to store prediction data.
Save each prediction with details like image name, predicted class, confidence score, and timestamp.
Retrieve stored predictions for analysis or reusability.
